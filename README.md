👨‍💻 Tarun — Full Stack Developer | Future SDE

🚀 I'm a developer who believes in clarity, structure, and building things that matter (and having a little fun doing it). I specialize in crafting scalable full-stack applications with:

MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

Java (Programming Fundamentals & DSA)

DevOps tools like GitHub Actions and Docker

AWS for cloud infrastructure and deployment best practices

🛠️ I build to learn, and I learn fast. Every project I touch is intentional — focused on real-world functionality, clean code, and meaningful impact. If it's not elegant and useful, I’m not done yet.

💡 What I'm into:

Product-based development

Startup engineering

System design and deployment

Developer tooling and efficiency

📂 Featured Projects

portfolio — Clean, responsive personal site built with React & Tailwind (in progress)

auth-system-api — Full backend auth system using JWT, Node, and MongoDB

DSA-Java — Java-based Leetcode patterns & solutions, clean and commented
