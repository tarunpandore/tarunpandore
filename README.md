# 👋 Hi, I'm Tarun

I’m a final-year Computer Science student who builds things to truly understand them.

I work across frontend, backend, and cloud — not because I’m chasing titles, but because I like understanding how systems connect end-to-end. I’ve built and deployed real projects, experimented with infrastructure, and learned that clean architecture and clarity matter more than flashy features.
